Requirements


1. Map: When a user visit the site, they should be able to see two layers, i.e., a layer of Calgary schools and a layer of Calgary clinics and hospitals.
-Schools are repersented by books, the hospitals/clinics are repersented by the red cross. The two layers are shown when the user visits the site.

2. Analysis: When a user clicks on a school, the map will show which 
clinic or hospital is nearest.
-The closest hospital/clinic is highlighted in black when a school is clicked on. It also displays it on the sidebar.

3. Mapping Library: You can use any mapping library of your choice. You can stay with Leaflet or you can simply follow Mapbox tutorial and use Mapbox GL.

Used Mapbox GL for practice
